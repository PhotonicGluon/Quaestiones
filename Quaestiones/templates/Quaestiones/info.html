                Hello! Welcome to <em>Quaestiones</em>! I hope you like this small website.

            <p>
                <em>What does the word Quaestiones mean?</em> Quaestiones means questions in Latin. I felt that this
                name was appropriate as this is a questions-and-answers website, but aimed at a computer science crowd.
                The transmission of Greek logic to the West was also done through the latin medium, so it is also poetic
                in this way.
            </p>

                <em>Help! I'm stuck on a question!</em> If you get stuck, <em>try your solution against the
                example(s)</em> given in the question. You should get the same answers. If you do not, re-read the
                description of the question. <em>Did you misunderstand something?</em> If the examples work, and your
                answer is still incorrect, <em>build some test cases</em> for which you can verify the answer by hand
                and see if those work with your program. Make sure you have <em>the entire question's input</em>. If
                you're still stuck, you could <em>ask a friend for help</em>, or come back to the question later.
